### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eze Nzube Goodness( Xrole Diamond ) from Lagos Nigeria. I am techie and passionate about problem solving. A typical day for me, is a day spent in coding and learning of newer technologies. At the very basic, seeking, acquiring and exhibiting knowledge has been my culture right from birth. When I am not coding, I love to be with family, friends, loved ones or engage in activities like playing table tennis and perhaps skating.

I am a beneficiary of Google Africa scholarship 2018, with over three years of experience and still counting in Software Engineering. I've worked with companies like NESA by Makers, Local shelf, Andela and others. Currently, I work with ChurchPad as assistant Team Lead (Cross platform mobile app with Flutter) and mentor in Andela Learning Community.
